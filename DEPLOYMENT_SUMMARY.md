# AccessLink LGBTQ+ Website - Docker Migration Summary

## ✅ Successfully Completed

We have successfully migrated the AccessLink LGBTQ+ website to a Docker-hosted solution. Here's what was implemented:

### 🐳 Docker Setup
- **Base Image**: nginx:alpine (lightweight and secure)
- **Security**: Runs as non-root user, includes comprehensive security headers
- **Performance**: Gzip compression, caching, optimized nginx configuration
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and monitoring endpoints

### 📁 Files Created
- `Dockerfile` - Defines the container image
- `nginx.conf` - Custom nginx configuration with security and performance optimizations
- `docker-compose.yml` - Development environment setup
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production environment setup
- `.dockerignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from the Docker build
- `start-dev.sh` - Quick development startup script
- `deploy-prod.sh` - Production deployment script
- `README-Docker.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### 🚀 Current Status
- ✅ **Docker image built successfully**
- ✅ **Container running on port 3000**
- ✅ **Website accessible at http://localhost:3000**
- ✅ **Health check endpoint working at /health**
- ✅ **All static assets loading correctly**
- ✅ **Successfully merged from dev to main branch**
- ✅ **GitHub-based Docker builds implemented**
- ✅ **Production-ready deployment scripts created**

### 🔧 Features Implemented

#### Security
- CSP (Content Security Policy) headers
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Non-root user execution

#### Performance
- Gzip compression for text files
- Cache headers for static assets (1 year for images, 1 day for HTML/CSS/JS)
- Optimized nginx configuration
- Health check endpoints

#### Development & Production
- Separate configurations for dev and production
- Resource limits in production
- Logging configuration
- Auto-restart policies
- Health monitoring

### 🌐 Usage

#### Quick Start (Development)
```bash
cd /workspaces/AccessLink-LGBTQ/website
./start-dev.sh
# Website available at http://localhost:3000
```

#### Production Deployment
```bash
cd /workspaces/AccessLink-LGBTQ/website
./deploy-prod.sh
# Website available at http://localhost (port 80)
```

#### Manual Docker Commands
```bash
# Build
docker build -t accesslink-website .

# Run development
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --name accesslink-website accesslink-website

# Run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### 📊 Monitoring & Health

- **Health Check**: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
- **Container Status**: `docker ps`
- **Logs**: `docker logs accesslink-website`
- **Docker Compose Logs**: `docker-compose logs -f`

### 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **SSL/TLS**: Add HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificates
2. **Domain Setup**: Configure custom domain with DNS
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate deployments with GitHub Actions
4. **Monitoring**: Add Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
5. **Load Balancing**: Scale with multiple container instances

## 🎉 Mission Accomplished!

The AccessLink LGBTQ+ website is now successfully containerized and running in Docker. The setup is production-ready with security best practices, performance optimizations, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

**🔄 Successfully merged all Docker improvements from dev to main branch!**  
**✅ Both branches now contain the complete Docker-hosted website solution.**

**Live Website**: http://localhost:3000  
**Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health

### 📦 GitHub-Based Docker Builds
The website can now be built directly from GitHub without cloning:
```bash
# Build from GitHub repository
./build-from-git.sh

# Build locally
./build-local.sh
```
